** Fishing

After a tarp theme is loaded, it's colors will be accesible in the hash table tarp/theme -- thus, you may use the theme colors in other contexts by EG ~(ht-get tarp/theme :background)~. Current values and vague uses are outlined below:

The goal for this repo is primarily to bootstrap on other kits, and make it easy to enact wide effects with small changes.
