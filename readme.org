** Fishing

After a tarp theme is loaded, it's colors will be accesible in the hash table tarp/theme -- thus, you may use the theme colors in other contexts by EG ~(ht-get tarp/theme :background)~. Current values and vague uses are outlined below:

| label         | meaning                                  | example               |
|---------------+------------------------------------------+-----------------------|
| :foreground   | default foreground                       |                       |
| :foreground_  | faded foreground                         | comments              |
| :foreground+  | emphasized foreground                    | urgent notification   |
| :background   | default background                       |                       |
| :background_  | faded background                         | modeline              |
| :background__ | alternate background                     | code block background |
| :background+  | emphasized background                    | highlighted text      |
| :accent1      | (foreground) identity                    | functions, variables  |
| :accent1_     | (foreground) assumptions (faded accent1) | builtins              |
| :accent2      | (foreground) accent2                     | types                 |
| :accent2_     | (foreground) strings                     | strings               |


The goal for this repo is primarily to bootstrap on other kits, and make it easy to enact wide effects with small changes.

** Local edits

The function ~tarp/tweak-function~ will be called before base16 is bootstrapped. You may change all the values of the scheme through the hashtable variable ~tarp/theme~ here. An example is shown below. The helper function ~tarp/edit~ can be used to iterate over all values in ~tarp/theme~, and takes a function that acts on keys (eg ~:accent1~) and values (eg ~"#dd88ff"~). You could do things here like enforce preferred contrast constraints, or try to account for your [[https://notes.neeasade.net/color-spaces.html#h-f23b8fe5-37a3-4ead-9d9d-a7139f76d532][viewing setting]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq tarp/tweak-function
  (lambda ()
    ;; max out the faded fg color chroma:
    (let ((faded-fg (ht-get tarp/theme :foreground_)))
      (ht-set tarp/theme :foreground_
        (ct/transform-lch-c faded-fg 100)))

    ;; make every color darker by reducing lightness @ 70%:
    (tarp/edit
      (lambda (key val)
        (ct/transform-hsl-l val
          (lambda (l) (* 0.7 l)))))))
#+end_src

** Contrast dumping

Calling ~tarp/show-contrasts~ will show the contrast ratios of all the foregrounds against all the backgrounds.
