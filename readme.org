A pair of light themes for GUI Emacs, built on top of [[https://github.com/belak/base16-emacs][base16-emacs]], with some tweaks.

Namespace prefix: ~tarp/~

** Fishing

Tarp colorschemes come flavored against different backgrounds, for different levels of emphasis. This is to ensure the same contrast level across different contexts. The schemes are stored in a nested hash table, with a helper to access them -- EG ~(tarp/get :primary :strong)~ to get the primary foreground color meant to be used against the strong background (which you could get with ~(tarp/get :background :strong)~). The available background keys are: ~:normal :weak :strong :focused~. For each of those, the following foregrounds are available:

| label        | meaning                             | example                                      |
|--------------+-------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| :foreground  | default foreground                  |                                              |
| :foreground+ | focused foreground                  | selected list item/search result             |
| :faded       | (foreground) faded                  | comments                                     |
| :primary     | (foreground) identity               | functions, variables                         |
| :assumed     | (foreground) assumptions/core stuff | builtins, key words                          |
| :alt         | (foreground) rarely used fg         | types, matching string within search results |
| :strings     | (foreground) strings                | strings                                      |

Some thoughts on general theme opinions:

- Strings are important enough to get their own color for emphasis because they represent the edges or barriers at which things communicate sometimes
- Identity between functions and variables can be blended (lisp-1 type of feel)
- "focused" colors should be consistent as an indicator of what's about to be selected/or where the cursor is
# - Different levels of BG sets allow for consistent communication across contrasted emphasis contexts

** TODO Local edits

The function ~tarp/tweak-function~ will be called before base16 is bootstrapped. You may change all the values of the scheme through the hashtable variable ~tarp/theme~ here. An example is shown below. ~tarp/set. You could do things here like enforce preferred contrast constraints, or try to account for your [[https://notes.neeasade.net/color-spaces.html#h-f23b8fe5-37a3-4ead-9d9d-a7139f76d532][viewing setting]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq tarp/tweak-function
  (lambda ()
    ;; max out the faded fg color chroma:
    (let ((faded-fg (ht-get tarp/theme :foreground_)))
      (ht-set tarp/theme :foreground_
        (ct/transform-lch-c faded-fg 100)))

    ;; make every color darker by reducing lightness @ 70%:
    (tarp/edit
      (lambda (key val)
        (ct/transform-hsl-l val
          (lambda (l) (* 0.7 l)))))))
#+end_src

** Contrast dumping

Calling ~tarp/show-contrasts~ will show the contrast ratios of all the foregrounds against all the backgrounds.
